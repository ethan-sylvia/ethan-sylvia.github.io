                <h2>Overview</h2>

                <p>
                    In terms of functionality, little has changed between my MP2 to my MP3. The bulk of my time
                    was spent integrating my game into React, which took much longer than anticipated. The game 
                    is hosted  <a href="https://ethans24.github.io">here</a>, and the code can be found <a href="https://github.com/ethans24/ethans24.github.io/tree/master"> here.</a>
                    I also spent a lot of time cleaning up my code because it was really messy, and I had a 
                    handful of bugs in my original game which I fixed. I'm planning to continue building upon
                    my Tetris game for my final project using React so majority of my time was spent integrating
                    my game into React, which took much longer than anticpated. Because of this, I was unable to integrate P5 sound into 
                    my game but I plan to do this for future steps. The libraries I used were:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>React</li>
                    <li>React-P5</li>
                    <li>React-gh-pages</li>
                    <li>P5</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    I was also planning on moving my portfolio to React, but I had several roadblocks which prevented me from doing this, so
                    I'm planning on doing this later.

                    My steps were as followed:

                <ul>
                    <li>Integrate my P5 game into React using React-P5</li>
                    <li>Re-implement keyboard controls for React by using event handling</li>
                    <li>Clean up code</li>
                    <li>Fix miscellaneous bugs</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    I created the foundation of my tetris game in sketch 4, which can be seen below.

                    The first step thing I needed to do for this was create blocks that spawn randomly along the 
                    screens x-axis that fall by themself. After falling off the screen, my program needed to save the
                    properties of the block so I could continue drawing them, and then I needed to spawn new blocks. After this,
                    I created keyboard controls to allow the user to move the blocks via arrow keys.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I expanded upon this sketch in sketch7, where I created a grid to facilitate the tetris game. Currently I'm working
                    on sketch 7 to allow blocks that reach the bottom of the screen to stack on top of eachother.

                <h2>Issue Deep Dive</h2>

                <p>
                    I think the most difficult part of my tetris game was figuring out the schema I would use to store information
                    about blocks because each tetris "block" in my game is actually made up of several rectangle items. I also
                    need to store the color of the block so my program could remember what to draw it as. My first instinct
                    was to create a Block class that would store an individual rectangle in a custom linked list data structure, but trying to
                    implementing this seemed needlesly complex. I instead decided to store this information in an array of dictionarys. All the tetris blocks
                    were stored in an array called AllBlocks. Individual blocks would be stored as a dictionary, with a field for color and a field for 
                    an array of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents the coordinates for the individual rectangles used to make the whole block.

                <h2>Ideas & Future</h2>

                <p>
                    I'm working on making my tetris game at least somewhat functional. Right now I'm using a 2d array as a
                    representation of the game board to easily track which grid spaces are taken up by the blocks so additional blocks
                    are able to stack on eachother.
