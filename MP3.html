                <h2>Overview</h2>

                <p>
                    In terms of functionality, little has changed between my MP2 to my MP3. The bulk of my time
                    was spent integrating my game into React, which took much longer than anticipated. The game 
                    is hosted  <a href="https://ethans24.github.io">here</a>, and the code can be found <a href="https://github.com/ethans24/ethans24.github.io/tree/master"> here.</a>
                    I also spent a lot of time cleaning up my code because it was really messy, and I had a 
                    handful of bugs in my original game which I fixed. I'm planning to continue building upon
                    my Tetris game for my final project using React so majority of my time was spent integrating
                    my game into React, which took much longer than anticpated. Because of this, I was unable to integrate P5 sound into 
                    my game but I plan to do this for future steps. The libraries I used were:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>React</li>
                    <li>React-P5</li>
                    <li>React-gh-pages</li>
                    <li>P5</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    I was also planning on moving my portfolio to React, but I had several roadblocks which prevented me from doing this, so
                    I'm planning on doing this later.

                <h2>Issue Deep Dive</h2>

                <img src="./bug.gif">
                <p>
                    One issue I ran into was fixing a bug where players could move their Tetris block 
                    outside of the grid (shown above). This involved creating some conditional statements to determine 
                    the block starting coordinates & ending coordinates and comparing it to the coordinates of the grid. This was fairly easy to achieve
                    as my units are consistent throughout the program, as all rectangles are the same size.

                    The issue I spent the most time debugging was figuring out how to handle events in my React. Originally, I used a library
                    called p5-react-wrapper, but it had really poor documentation on how to acheive this. I eventually switched to using p5-react 
                    and I was eventually able to re-implement the keyboard controls.

                <h2>Ideas & Future</h2>
                <p>
                    I think I have implemented almost all the basic functionality of Tetris, besides allowing blocks to rotate. 
                    As I mentioned earlier, I'm planning on continuing to work on this game for my final project, and my end goal 
                    is to record player statistics and build additional features that leverage this data, which could include:
                </p>
    
                <ul>
                    <li>Implement a high-fidelity tetris UI</li>
                    <li>Build a login feature for users to sign up</li>
                    <li>Store data about individual users in persistent storage</li>
                    <li>Build a user data schema to store relevent information</li>
                    <li>Allow players to view personal statistics across all the games they have played</li>
                    <li>Leaderboards showing top players across a variety of statistics</li>
                </ul>
