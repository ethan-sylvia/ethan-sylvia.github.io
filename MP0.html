                <p>
                    My process for building this website
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Build the navbar</li>
                    <li>Copy styles from my current portfolio</li>
                    <li>Build pages asked for in the spec</li>
                    <li>Google when confused</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    I have prior experience with using HTMl/CSS but it's been a long time, so I decided to 
                    build the navbar first to reintroduce basic web dev concepts.

                <h2>Issue</h2>

                <p>
                    The part I struggled with for the longest while building
                    the website was a bug I had with my dropdown menu. I knew
                    I needed to have the dropdown containers display value change
                    when the dropdown button was hovered, but the bug below happened
                </p>

                <img src="./errorgif.gif">

                <p>
                    After some time googling on stackoverflow, I determined the issue 
                    was due to the containers height shifting the navbar links up, when I needed the container to grow in a downwards direction, under the button. I fixed this by setting position: fixed because
                    this forces the container to stay in it's current spot, even if it's height changes.

            <div class= "writeupdiv"> 
                <h2>CSS Transition</h2>

                <p>
                    I used a dropdown menu element to be used for my CSS transition. I chose this because I wanted
                    my navbar to include a section for my writeups, and since there will be more than one writeup 
                    this can let me easily add more links in the future. I made this work by styling the writeups button to 
                    look like the other links in the navbar. I then set display: none for the link container because I didn't 
                    want users to see it until they hover over the link, which changes the display: block.

                    My actual portfolio is still a WIP, so some of these ideas for the future include

                    <li>Personal logo that can be used in the navbar</li>
